# PetRescuePlanner

Pet Rescue Planner was developed by Dan Rodosky, Dan Jin, Mike Budd, and Brian Licea.

Pet Rescue Planner is a pet adoption app that allows users to search for and save pets in their area.

Technologies used include RESTful API, Core Data, CloudKit, AutoLayout, MapKit, and more.


Features:

SMOOTH AND OPTIMIZED SWIPING EXPERIENCE

We customized petfinder.com's public API to provide a smooth and optimized Tinder-style swiping experience.

Users can swipe right to save a pet to favorites, or swipe left to simply go to the next pet without saving.


DATA IS AUTO-SYNCED ACROSS YOUR DEVICES

Saved pets (Core Data) are synced to the cloud (CloudKit), making the data available on any iOS device for the user.

The pets you save or delete on one device will auto-sync and update across all your devices.

Even if you delete and reinstall the app, or do a fresh install on a new device, your favorite pets will always be synced and available.


EASY SHARING & ACCESS TO SHELTER INFORMATION

Call, email, or get directions to the shelter for the pet you are interested in.

Share images and information for any pet with your friends via social media, text, or email.
